# Health cost prediction with regression

## CS50
>This was my final project for conclude the CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science.

>python, ML, Linear regression, flask, web development, CS50P
## Features

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

It's predicting healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.

Given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs.

It has converted categorical data to numbers and were used 80% of the data as the `train_dataset` and 20% of the data as the `test_dataset`.

`pop` off the "expenses" column from these datasets to create new datasets called `train_labels` and `test_labels`. These labels were used when training this model.

Model has been created and trained with the `train_dataset`. The final cell have used the unseen `test_dataset` to check how well the model generalizes.

The final cell also predicts expenses using the `test_dataset` and graph the results.




I've used Scikit-learn and Flask web framework based in Python
it was necessary to use Scikit-learn for Machine Learning and Flask, which provides configuration and conventions, with sensible defaults

## Explaining the project
My final project is a website written in python that allows the user to enter candidate's experience, interview scores, and test results to get wage prediction, and moreover this form has link to my portfolio website.

## project.py for Machine Learning, test_project.py for testing, app.py for a website in which this ML model predicts the candidate wage
All information about experience, test scores, interview scores and wages for each candidate are stored in job_search.csv.


### ML model can be saved in file with ".pkl" extension


## Demonstration on youtube
For the CS50 final project you have to make a video showning your project,

## About CS50
CS50 is a openware course from Havard University and taught by David J. Malan

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.
